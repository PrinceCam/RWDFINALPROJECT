<!-- *## Your Task

You've been tasked with creating a homepage for an imaginary community college. The design should be professional, trustworthy, and user-friendly, reflecting the institution's academic nature.

The college has provided specific layout requirements, and you're encouraged to bring your creativity to the table. While a reference image is available, you should focus on the rubric and make the design uniquely yours.

## Mock-Up
![Example](./wireframe.png)

## User Story

```
AS A prospective student or parent
I WANT to visit the community college's homepage
SO THAT I can quickly understand the college's offerings, navigate to relevant sections, and trust the institution's professionalism.
```

## Design Specifications & Requirements

### Layout

- The page should feature a three-column layout:
  - **50%** width for summaries and elevator pitches.
  - **25%** width for the top 10 course choices (with an option to see more).
  - **25%** width for a navigation bar.

### Fonts
- Download two free-to-use fonts:
  - A **serif** font for the general body text.
  - A **sans-serif** or **slab serif** for the headings.
 
- Use a reliable service to generate `@font-face` code for these fonts.
- Apply the body font site-wide and the heading font to all headings.

### Styling

- Implement either **flexbox** or **grid** in the homepage design.
- Set a site-wide font-size of **10px**.
- Define appropriate font-sizes for headings and other elements using a relative unit.
- Assign a suitable line-height to the body text.
- Center the top-level heading.
- Adjust letter-spacing for headings and body text for readability.

### Links

- Style link focus and hover states to match the color of the horizontal bars at the page's top and bottom.
- By default, links should be underlined. This underline should disappear on hover or focus.
- Remove the default focus outline from all links.
- Style the active state distinctly, ensuring it complements the overall design.
- External links should have an external link icon next to them.

### Lists

- Ensure list spacing complements the overall page design.
- Style list items with a custom bullet or another appropriate design.

### Navigation Menu

- Design the navigation menu to harmonize with the page. It doesn't necessarily need to resemble buttons but should be vertically oriented and appropriately sized.

### Footer

- Incorporate a footer at the bottom of the page.

## GitHub Requirements

- Create a GitHub repository for this project.
- Commit regularly with descriptive messages after completing sections or elements.
- Once the project is complete, push the repository and deploy it on GitHub Pages.
- Submit both the repository link and the GitHub Pages link via Google Classroom.

## Hints and Tips

- The navigation menu should be taller to fit the side of the page appropriately.
- Remember, this is a vertical navigation menu.

## Stretch Goals

If you found the main task straightforward, challenge yourself further:

- Incorporate media queries to enhance the website's responsiveness and flow. -->
